    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "The linear regression you've done so far uses a single predictor variable. But luckily you can also do linear regression with more than one independent variable. If the outcome depends on more than one variable, you can make a more complicated model that takes this into account! As long as they're relevant to the situation, using more independent/predictor variables can help you get you a better prediction! When there's just one predictor, the linear regression model is a line, but as you add more predictor variables, you're adding more dimensions to the picture.\n",
    "When you have one predictor variable, the equation of the line is\n",

    "Linear regression with two predictor variables\n",
    "You can use more than two predictor variables, in fact you should use as many as is useful! If you use n predictor variables, then the model can be represented by the equation\n",
